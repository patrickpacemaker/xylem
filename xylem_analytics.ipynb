    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Daytime Analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The warehouse has detailed insights into its daily operations, including the exact timing of item receipts and shipments.\n",
    "- Precise lists of average values and peak times on a daily, weekday, and other levels have been created, leading to the development of various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).\n",
    "- These insights can be leveraged to plan and optimize labor schedules efficiently, improving workforce management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inventory Level Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inventory data is available from January 2021 onward, allowing for a thorough analysis of SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) inventory.\n",
    "- The warehouse can accurately replicate the flow of products between inbound and outbound processes.\n",
    "- The duration of time that items spend in the warehouse between inbound and outbound processes is known.\n",
    "- Average values for each SKU and clustering by priority and moving speed provide valuable insights.\n",
    "- Identification of overstocked, understocked, and normally behaving SKUs is possible.\n",
    "- This information can be used to create digital twins for inventory management and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Turnover Rate Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Turnover rates for individual SKUs/items have been calculated on monthly, quarterly, and annual levels.\n",
    "- Classic turnover rate calculations and alternative calculations using inventory averages provide different perspectives on turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pallet Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metrics related to LPNs (License Plate Numbers) and sub-LPNs have been identified to understand the logic behind these identifiers.\n",
    "- Key metrics include identifying the most frequently used LPNs and sub-LPNs, tracking which items use them the most, and creating a frequency identifier for items based on delivery frequency.\n",
    "- Comparing LPN and sub-LPN frequency with item frequency provides insights into their usage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Conclusion:\n",
    "The analyses conducted demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the warehouse's data and operations. The insights gained from these initial analyses offer significant potential for process optimization within the warehouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "Demand Forecasting: By leveraging inventory levels, demand forecasts can be conducted to determine which products are needed and when. This, combined with other metrics like overstocking/understocking trends and turnover rates, can enhance accuracy in product availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Workforce Optimization: Knowledge of SKU arrival/loading times and peak/average times at various levels allows for precise staff planning, leading to more efficient workforce management.\n",
    "\n",
    "LPN/Sub-LPN Logic: While much has been understood, there is still room for comprehending the complete logic behind LPNs and sub-LPNs. A site visit to observe warehouse processes directly could provide further insights and opportunities for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the warehouse possesses a wealth of data-driven insights that can be harnessed to enhance operational efficiency, optimize inventory management, and improve workforce planning. Further exploration and on-site observations can uncover additional opportunities for optimization and refinement."

    "# Inventory Metrics Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "Inventory management is crucial in optimizing the efficiency and profitability of a business. Two key metrics often used in inventory analysis are the Average Inventory and the Inventory Turnover Rate. These metrics help businesses understand how effectively they are managing their inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculation of Average Inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "The Average Inventory is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Total Received} + \\text{Total Shipped}}{2} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "- **Total Received**: This is the sum of the quantities of all items received in the warehouse over a specified period.\n",
    "- **Total Shipped**: This is the sum of the quantities of all items shipped out of the warehouse over the same period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total_received = df['Quantity'].sum()\n",
    "total_shipped = df_shipping['Quantity'].sum()\n",
    "average_inventory = (total_received + total_shipped) / 2\n"
